Description: The robust variance score (RVS) is a likelihood-based method that
    substitutes genotype calls by their expected values given observed sequence
    data. RVS eliminates read depth bias in the estimation of minor allele
    frequency. It controls Type I error and has comparable power to the 'gold
    standard' analysis with the true underlying genotypes for both common and
    rare variants.
